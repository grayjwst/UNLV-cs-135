# UNLV CSC 135 1998

## Overview

This repository contains the first semester projects of CS students at UNLV taking CSC 135 in Fall 1998. These were meant for students with limited/no programming experience, and uses math that they likely learned from high school. However, the projects also go into detail about each math process, so knowing how the math works wasn't a requirement to complete the assignments.

That being the case, it is my opinion that these projects mostly served to teach three things: the basics of computer programming, how we read algorithms given to us, and how we write down our own algorithms. Keep that in mind while you work through these.

## Homework Layout

Each homework folder is really simple. They contain a pdf (or in one case a txt file) that contains what we call your "project specifications". Additionally, some projects have an associated `.data` file, which contains any needed data for the project.

Some projects originally had some starter/template/boiler plate code that students started with, but because we haven't settled on a language quite yet I haven't included those. When we get to those projects I will spin up any of the boiler plate code you'll need. Also, in case it wasn't clear, please keep the code for each project inside its respective folder.

## Roadmap

- [x] HW1 - Perimeter and Area of a Square
- [x] HW2 - Electric Bill Calculator
- [x] HW3 - Cramer's Rule
- [ ] HW4 - Volume and Surface Area of a Cone
- [ ] HW5 - Quadratic Equation Solver
- [ ] HW6 - University Class Scheduler
- [ ] HW7 - Approximate Pi
- [ ] HW8 - Balancing Checking Account
- [ ] HW9 - LCM and GCD functions
- [ ] HW10 - Number to Word Conversion

## Notes

* Originally each project would have been allocated about a week to complete, and while that is something that we can aspire to, it isn't a rule we need to worry about.
* Before you start each homework it is probably best that we meet face-to-face for at least a few minutes so that we can talk about what is coming up.
* It's also worth noting that these assignments could be considered rather boring. If you want something more inspired, feel free to suggest a new homework to replace it.
* One thing that you could (and should) look to add yourself is any fun side project you'd like to do. You will for sure have all the tools you need for a Choose Your Own Adventure book after Homework 6, but that might be too long without something fun. One fun idea could be a program to encode secret messages using [Caesar's Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), which we could do after Homework 2. 
* If there's something important to you that we start sooner though, let me know and I'll help get us there faster.
